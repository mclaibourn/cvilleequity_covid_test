The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted lives across our community. The impact of shelter in place orders, school and business closures, and health burdens are felt everywhere, and yet they are not felt everywhere in equal measure. Inspired by work around the country, conversations with our partners, and the commendable and innovative efforts around our community, we are working to highlight and open available data to support all those working to improve lives, promote community resilience, create a more equitable processes, policies, and structures for our community.

<h2>Shelter in Place</h2>

    <p>Building from work like UCLA’s <a href="https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/2020/04/22/neighborhood-inequality-in-shelter-in-place-burden/">“Neighborhood Inequality in Shelter-in-Place Burden”</a> and the King County, WA <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/elected/executive/equity-social-justice/2020/COVID-19/King-County-Equity-Impact-Awareness-Tool.ashx?la=en">Equity Impact tool</a>, and working in partnership with community organizers and leaders, we set out to understand the disparate impact of the pandemic in our own community. This is an initial attempt to create a Shelter-in-Place index of burden or ease for the larger Charlottesville region to help decision makers, advocates, and residents better visualize the differential experiences and needs across our larger community. </p>
        
    <p>Emphasizing the structures that make social distancing and staying at home easier or more challenging, we created an score based on populatio density, crowded housing conditions, access to private transportation, broadband, and food, and the presence of children in the absence of school or daycare. High values represent the presence of more challenges in an area; lower values represent greater ease of sheltering in place.</p>
        
    <p>We've struggled with framing the structural factors that impact the experience of shelting in place around the ease experienced by some communities or around the burden experienced by others. Here, we capture a composite score that highlights the challenges -- high scores reflect greater burdens -- while recognizing that these are two sides of the same coin, the relative ease experienced by many in our region comes at the expense of neighbors.</p>
